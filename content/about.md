I am a Research Associate at the School of Informatics at the University of
Edinburgh, working in the Compiler and Architecture Design Group within the
Institute for Computing Systems Architecture. I'm currently looking at
Data-Centric Parallisation - automatic parallelisation by analysing and
abstracting a program's data structures.
